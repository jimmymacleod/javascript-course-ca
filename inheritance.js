When multiple classes share properties or methods, 
they become candidates for inheritance â€” a tool developers 
use to decrease the amount of code they need to write.

With inheritance, you can create a parent class (also known as a superclass)
with properties and methods that multiple child classes (also known as subclasses)
share. The child classes inherit the properties and methods from their parent class.
